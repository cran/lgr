# lgr 0.3.3

* Fixed a performance regression when looking up the parent of a Logger. This
  notably affected the performance of "do-nothing" logging (e.g. when a 
  log message is discarded because it is below a loggers' threshold)
  

# lgr 0.3.2

* Added AppenderSyslog for logging to syslog via 
  [rsyslog](https://github.com/atheriel/rsyslog) (thanks to atheriel)


# lgr 0.3.1

  * Added `logger_tree()` which provides an overview of all registered loggers
  * Added `print()` and `format()` methods for Appenders
  * `AppenderMemory`: added `data` and `dt` active fields (which return the
    log as a data.frame or data.table)
  * Removed deprecated functions `FATAL()`, `ERROR()`. Use `lgr$fatal()`, 
    `lgr$error()`, ... instead.
  * `AppenderMemory`: `$buffer_dt()` and `$show()` now handle custom fields
    containing atomic vectors correctly


# lgr 0.3.0

  * Added support for rotating log files via `AppenderFileRotating`, 
    `AppenderFileRotatingDate` and `AppenderFileRotatingTime`. Requires the
    package [rotor](https://github.com/s-fleck/rotor).
  * functions like `show_log()`, `show_data()`,... now accept logger names as
    well as Logger or Appender objects as `target`.
  * `AppenderFile$new()` now creates an empty file, or fails if it can't
  * Improved support for RMariaDB and dropped support for RMySQL
  * Improved support for RPostgres and dropped support for RPostgreSQL
  * added `reset` argument to `get_logger()`. This completely resets the
    configuration of the logger and also replaces special loggers (such as 
    `LoggerGlue`) with vanilla ones.


# lgr 0.2.2

* The root logger can now be configured via `options()` and/or environment 
  variables (see `?lgr`)
* `basic_config()` now accepts thresholds ("info", "fatal") as arguments to
  `console` and `memory`. 
* The default config of the root logger has changed. It now only has a
  console appender and a default threshold of `"info"`. To get
  back the old behaviour run 
  `basic_config(threshold = "all", console = "info", memory = "all")`.
* `$config(NULL)` now resets a Logger to its default/unconfigured state
* `$config()` now accepts YAML as well as JSON files (or YAML/JSON as a 
  character string)
* `with_log_level()` and `with_log_value()` now accept logger names as well as 
  Logger objects as the `logger` argument
* `get_logger_glue()` now works as intended
* Deprecated `FATAL()`, `ERROR()`. Use `lgr$fatal()`, `lgr$error()`, ... instead.


# lgr 0.2.1

* Emergency fix that ensures test suite cleans up temporary files 
* Removed .rd file for the unexported LoggerRoot class


# lgr 0.2.0

* `get_loggers()` registers new loggers in the lgr::loggers namespace, this 
  is a more global and decoupled approach similar to how python logging handles 
  loggers. 
* removed `full_name` active binding for loggers. Loggers now only have 
  qualified names and `name` is now identical to what `full_name` was before.
  For consistency the format method of `ancestry` has also been revised.
* Logger inheritance is now derived from the qualified name of a logger. 
  Consequently `lg$parent` is now derived from `lg$name`, `lg$set_parent()` 
  is no longer possible.
* If no threshold is set for a new Logger, it now inherits the threshold
  of its parent
* Depend on R6 >= 2.4.0 which includes relevant fixes to finalizers. finalize 
  methods are now private.
* Logger now have a `config` method that allows configuring Loggers with config
  objects and YAML files (experimental)
* added `with_logging()`, the opposite of `without_logging()`. This can be
  handy for automated tests where you might want so switch logging off/on only
  for specific unit tests.


# lgr 0.1.1

* Added `show_data()` and `show_dt()` for quick access to the root loggers
  in memory log as `data.frame` or `data.table` respectively
* numerous small fixes
* removed non-breaking-spaces from .RD files. This caused unforeseen problems 
  with the compiling the .pdf manual during the CRAN submission process.
